# VirtX Resources

This is the Resource portal for the [VirtX Community of Practice](http://virtx.online) at the University of Sydney. Here we will try to maintain an updated list of free usable resources for classroom VR, MR and AR projects.

## Information and publications

- [The Trend report on VR](http://trends.techlab.works/trend/30)
- [The Trend report on MR](http://trends.techlab.works/trend/24)
- [The Trend report on Industry X.0](http://trends.techlab.works/trend/33)

### Publications:

- [Towards a Long Term Model of Virtual Reality Exergame Exertion](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3079679)

### Startups Curently being Incubated and supported by VirtX.

- [Denouement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CKzjGLtf5w) : A VR startup targeting corporate education on LGBT issues in the workplace.
- [Unbound Laboratories](https://unboundlabs.techlab.works/) : A VR simulation platofrm for Wet lab simulations in an immersive and interactive environment. 
- An as yet un-named startup specialising in holographic warehouse solutions (in collaboration with Swiss Log).

## Videos tutorials and guides

- [Getting started with Unity](https://unity3d.com/learn/get-started)
- [Creating your first Google Cardboard/Daydream app](https://developers.google.com/vr/develop/unity/get-started-android)

## Libraries for Web development in XR

- [Kaleidoscope.js](https://github.com/thiagopnts/kaleidoscope) is a lightweight embeddable 360 Video or imagery library for webpages. It is in use on the VirtX homepage as well as in the TechLab [venues prototype](http://venues.techlab.works)
- [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) a web framework for building virtual reality experiences with the Vive, Rift, Daydream, GearVR and Desktop.

## AR Frameworks
- [Vuforia](https://www.vuforia.com/) an AR framework for multi-platform devices (Desktop, Mobile, VR Headsets etc).
